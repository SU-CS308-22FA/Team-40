What is TPIBS
While 3-player rule is highly debated, TPIBS aims to encourage the clubs to give more play time to Turkish players in an alternative way.
TPIBS provides constantly updated statistics of Turkish Players and with respect to statistics of the given player, a cumulative rating is determined for that player.
Also each club is subjected to a competition with respect to their statistics of giving Turkish Player opportunities.
TPIBS is also a tool that visualizes statistics of both players and clubs. TPIBS users can share their ideas on clubs and players to take part in discussion.
